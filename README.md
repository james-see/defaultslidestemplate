# Quickest Slides

I wanted a way to edit and deploy slides quickly for fun and profit.

This uses a self-contained index.html that includes remark.js and css to get the job done.

## quickstart

clone this repo and run ./runlocal.sh to get the hang of it

## deploy

you can deploy for free to surge.sh via ./surgeit.sh and edit the CNAME file in `surge/CNAME` to use the same static FQDN each time.
